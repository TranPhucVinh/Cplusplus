# Find words that can be formed by characters (Leetcode 1160)
You are given an array of strings words and a string chars. A string is good if it can be formed by characters from chars (each character can only be used once). Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in words.

* Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach". Output: 6. Explanation: The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.
* Input: words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr". Output: 10. Explanation: The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10.
* words = 'boygirdlggnh', chars = "usdruypficfbpfbivlrhutcgvyjenlxzeovdyjtgvvfdjzcmikjraspdfp". Output: 0
