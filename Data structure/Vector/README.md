Vectors are the same as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted.

# [Vector operations](Vector%20operations.md)

[Create](Create.md): 
* Multiple ways to define a vector 
* const char pointer as member of a vector
* Class object as a member of a vector

**Read**: Find a member by **std::find()**

**Update**: Update vector at specific by index

# [Vector and function]()
# Implementations
* Convert an integer to Roman numeral by using **vector tuple**: [vector_tuple_integer_to_roman_numeral.cpp](../src/vector_tuple_integer_to_roman_numeral.cpp)
