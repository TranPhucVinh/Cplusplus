**Class** is a group of objects having the same properties. Every class has at least one constructor. **Constructor** is like a function and is used to express the attribute of an object. Constructor doesn't have returned type like ``void``, ``int``,... and doesn't have return value.

**Default constructors** have the same name with the class
